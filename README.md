# JavaScript-Quiz

## A quiz I made using JavaScript that tests you on basic JavaScript questions collecting points converting it into a score that can be saved.

In ths project I worked on making a quiz using all the things I learned from class on javascript, this Quiz will take your output and give you a score that can be saved and points are gained from correct answers.

### Things I worked on
-localStorage for saving the scores 

-making multiple questions pop on the screen using hide class

-time intervals that can be deducted when a question is answered wrong

-event listeners and functions.
